The Gradle plugin used to run the system tests supports the debugging of the services running inside Docker containers.
This makes debugging issues with system tests so much less painful.

**Note:** Service debugging is currently only supported through the IntelliJ IDE. 
If you're using another IDE, then please consider contributing to get service debugging working for your IDE.

## Prerequisites

Debugging of services currently requires the [AttachMe][attachMe] IntelliJ plugin to be installed.

The `aggregate-template` repository has preconfigured the service to support debugging.

**ProTip:** Details of what configuration is required, if you want to dig into the details, can be found in the
[creek-system-test][sysTestRequirements] and [system-test Gradle plugin][pluginRequirements] docs.

## Debugging a service

With [AttachMe][attachMe] plugin installed, the `handle-occurrence-service` can be debugged with the following steps:

1. Create and run an `AttachMe` run configuration.
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-create-attachme-run-config.png" alt="AttacheMe run configuration" %}
2. Name the new configuration, but leave the default port at the default `7857`.
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-attachme-run-config.png" alt="AttacheMe run configuration details" %}   
3. Place the required breakpoints in the code. For example, place one in the `TopologyBuilder`'s `extractHandles()`
   method.
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-add-breakpoint.png" alt="Add breakpoint" %}
4. Run the system tests, specifying which service to debug:

   ```
   ./gradlew systemTest \
     --debug-service="handle-occurrence-service" \
     --verification-timeout-seconds=9999
   ```

When the system tests start the `handle-occurrence-service` Docker container, the service will attach to the debugger.
This will cause a new debug window to open and for the breakpoint to be hit:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-breakpoint-hit.png" alt="Breakpoint hit" %}

Pretty cool, right?

**ProTip:** The `--verification-timeout-seconds` argument increases the amount of time the system tests wait 
for the expected output, allowing more time to debug the code. Learn more on this, and other options, 
in the [system test plugin][systemTestOptions] documentation.
