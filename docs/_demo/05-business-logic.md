With the topic resources defined in the last step, it's time to write a simple [Kafka Streams][kafkaStreams] 
topology to perform the business logic of this service. 

The service will search each tweets text for occurrences of Twitter handles, e.g. `@katyperry`.
For each handle found, it will produce a record mapping the Twitter handle to its number of occurrences.
For example, it a tweet contained the handle `@katyperry` twice, then it would produce a record
with a key of `@katyperry` and a value of `2`.

## Define the stream topology

The aggregate template provided a shell `TopologyBuilder` class.
Flesh out the class's `build` method to match what's below:

{% highlight java %}
{% include_snippet build-method %}
{% endhighlight %}

The above topology consumes `TweetTextTopic` we defined in the service's descriptor, 
transforms it in the `extractHandles` method, 
and produces any output to the `TweetHandleUsageTopic`.

As a single input record can result in zero or more output records, depending on the occurrences of Twitter handles in the tweet text,
we use the `flatMap` method to invoke the `extractHandles` method.

The details of the `extractHandles` method is particularly important in the context of demonstrating Creek's functionality.
A simple solution might look like this:

{% highlight java %}
{% include_snippet extract-method %}
{% endhighlight %}

...and that's the production code of the service complete!

**ProTip:** The `Name` instance defined in the `TopologyBuilder` doesn't add much in this example, but as topologies 
get more complex, getting broken down into multiple builder classes, it really comes into its own. 
Check out its JavaDoc to see how it can be used to help avoid topology node name clashes.
